#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
#string

a = 5
a = 3.45

#float
name = "jayden"

#boolean

a = True 
a = False

#list

a = [3,4,5,6]

a = ["stringOne,stringTwo"]

a = [True,False,True]

a = [1.1,2.2,3.3]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA = 1
vara = 2

print (varA)

print (a)
#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
vara = 4
var = "string"

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
varTwo = var
print(varTwo)

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:
b = [a, varA, var]

list = ["a", "b", "c"]

print(list)
print(list[1])

listVar = list[1]
print(listVar)
#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:
string = "jayden"

print(string[0])
#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:
print(string)


#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
var = 4
 = 4
